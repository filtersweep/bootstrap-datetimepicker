This is a date and time picking widget for use with bootstrap.js and jQuery. The bulk of this code
was written by the following:

Thiago de Arruda (https://github.com/tarruda)
Stefan Petre (http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/)
Andrew Rowls (https://github.com/eternicode)
jdewit (https://github.com/jdewit)

I just made it jslint-friendly, added mysql-style date format tokens, and added a bunch	
of other convenience features.

Documentation is incoming.  In the meantime, use Thiago's great documentation here:
